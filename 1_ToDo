todo::: extensive testing, then tackle Kanji 

todo: also tally lines of data in SLOC 


::: cheat-sheet :

splat e  :: list of recent files
shift splat backspace/delete  :: move to where you last made an edit
splat [  :: to return to previous position||file  (multiple such commands will walk you back from whence you came).
splat ]  :: steps forward after you have stepped back. 

option-return  :: spell correction 
double-tap shift  :: key to search everywhere

splat F6  :: change/refactor signature (:::SUPER COOL!!!) 
Shift splat U  :: toggle case
splat b  :: go to declaration 

Ctrl-k  :: kill to end of line. 

::: end cheat-sheet.
