::: about prompting -- and testing

prompting: 
    whenever it is time to do any prompt, there are two things to consider: 
        1. whether the prompt should be of a Hira, Kata, or Romaji char (3 types)
        2. whether the prompt is of primary, secondary, or tertiary format. (3 types) 
    
guessMatch testing: 2 modalities to address ::: done/agreed 
    this should involve branching on one of two categories: Hira or Romaji guesses (two objective modalities) 
    -- the way I have been doing it is stupid! Trying to put the right one of these values in the right place at the right time makes the code obtuse!!

There must be just one structure that can always be trusted to contain all the up-to-date fields re data. ::: agreed 
And, one new structure for storing states: globals for ALL it shall be.

if it is asking for Hira and you give a Romaji it should inform you of your problem

option-return  :: spell correction 
double-tap shift  :: key to search everywhere

splat [  :: to return to previous position||file  (multiple such commands will walk you back from whence you came).
splat ]  :: steps forward after you have stepped back. 
splat e  :: list of recent files
shift splat backspace/delete  :: move to where you last made an edit

splat F6  :: change/refactor signature (:::SUPER COOL!!!)
